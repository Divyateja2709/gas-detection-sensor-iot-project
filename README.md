This project is an IoT-based gas detection system using an Arduino UNO and an MQ-2 gas sensor to detect hazardous gases like methane, CO, and LPG. The sensor measures gas concentration and sends data to the Arduino, which processes it and triggers an alarm (buzzer) and LCD display alerts when gas levels exceed a set threshold. The system is powered via USB or adapter and can be expanded with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for remote alerts. Connections include A0 (sensor) to A0 (Arduino), buzzer to pin 13, and LCD via the LiquidCrystal library. The Arduino IDE is used for programming, setting alert thresholds, and displaying gas levels. This cost-effective, real-time monitoring system enhances safety in homes and industries.
